  matrix:
    ## This matrix entry is required, but it doesn't actually create any jobs
    -

## We don't use the build matrix cross-product, because it makes too many jobs
## Instead, we list each job under matrix: include:
matrix:
  # include creates Linux, python 2.7 builds by default
  # the key(s) in each item override these defaults
  include:
    ## Test all supported python releases

    ## python in macOS on Travis is tricky:
    ##   - We use the default python version on macOS, which is currently 2.7.
    ##     (But we don't show the version, because Travis might change it
    ##     without us noticing.)
    ##   - We use language: c, because language: python fails on Travis macOS.

    ## We need to install python@2 in homebrew, to get pip[2]
    - os: osx
      language: c
      python:
      addons:
        ## (macOS only)

          ## See ticket #30928 for more information. This key should be
          ## removed at some point to speed up builds.
