The Tor Fallback Scripts are used to generate the hard-coded fallback
directory mirror lists for Tor. Tor uses fallback directory mirrors when it
is first installed, to find the rest of the Tor network. It also uses them
when its cached directory documents are very old.

(Tor protects your privacy on the internet by hiding the connection between
your Internet address and the services you use.)

To generate a fallback list using the current whitelist:
        ./updateFallbackDirs.py

To remove failed fallbacks from the existing hard-coded fallback list:
        cd ..
        git clone https://git.torproject.org/tor.git
        cd fallback-scripts
        ./updateFallbackDirs.py check_existing
